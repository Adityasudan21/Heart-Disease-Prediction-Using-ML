# Heart Disease Prediction 
**Discription**
The project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease based on a set of input parameters. This model will provide valuable insights for early intervention and proactive management of heart disease risk factors.

## Project Goals:

Develop an accurate predictive model for heart disease assessment.
Create a user-friendly interface for data input and model utilization.

### Dataset

Utilize a heart disease dataset from Kaggle containing relevant features and target labels.

### Machine Learning Model:

Implement the logistic regression algorithm for binary classification (heart disease or no heart disease).

## Features:

Include 11 key parameters as features, such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health indicators.

## Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, with a suitable ratio (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test).

## Evaluation Metrics:

Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

## Data Preprocessing:

Perform data cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling if necessary.
Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimize hyperparameters, such as regularization strength, using techniques like cross-validation.

## Model Training:

Train the logistic regression model using the training data and monitor convergence.

## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the validation and test sets, reporting key performance metrics.
Provide insights into model behavior and any observed patterns.

## Deployment:

Deploy the trained model, allowing users to input data and receive predictions.
